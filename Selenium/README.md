<summary><b>1. What is Selenium?</b></summary>

---

  <p>Selenium is an open-source automation testing tool used for testing web applications. It provides a set of libraries and APIs that allow developers to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and validate web application behavior. Selenium supports various programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.</p>

<summary><b>2. Which are the components of the Selenium suite</b></summary>

---

  <p>Selenium is not just a single tool or a utility. Rather, it’s a bundle of multiple test tools, referred to as a suite. Each of the tools is designed to meet specific criteria for testing and testing environments.

The suite package contains the following set of tools:

- **Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** – Open-source record and playback test automation for the web. This is distributed as a plug-in to Firefox and Chrome.

- **Selenium RC (Remote Control)** – Selenium RC is a server that allows a user to build test scripts in a desired programming language. It also enables test scripts to be performed across a wide spectrum of browsers.

- **Selenium WebDriver** – WebDriver is an entirely different tool, with different advantages over Selenium RC. WebDriver interacts directly with the web browser and makes use of its native compatibility to automate. 

- **Selenium Grid** – Selenium Grid is used to simultaneously distribute the test execution on multiple platforms and environments.

<summary><b>3. What is WebDriver?</b></summary>

---

  <p>WebDriver is a simple and concise programming interface. As an object-oriented and lightweight API, it drives the browser through interface-type reference variables.</p>

**1. WebDriver is a simple and concise programming interface:**

- WebDriver is an interface in Selenium that provides a set of methods and commands for controlling a web browser.
- It offers a simplified and easy-to-understand way to interact with web elements and perform actions on web pages.
- The design of the WebDriver interface aims to make it intuitive for developers to write automated tests and perform web automation tasks.

**2. As an object-oriented and lightweight API:**

- WebDriver follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which emphasizes the use of objects and classes to model real-world entities and interactions.
- In WebDriver, web browsers, web elements, and other components are represented as objects, and actions are performed by calling methods on these objects.
WebDriver is lightweight in the sense that it provides only the essential features and functionality needed for browser automation, without unnecessary complexity or overhead.

**3. It drives the browser through interface-type reference variables:**

- In WebDriver, you interact with the browser by creating objects of types that implement the WebDriver interface.
- When you create a WebDriver object, you typically declare it using the WebDriver interface type, like this: __WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()__; or __WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()__;.
- This approach allows for flexibility and modularity in your code because you can switch between different browser implementations (e.g., ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver) without changing much of your code.
- Using interface-type reference variables also promotes good programming practices, such as coding to interfaces rather than concrete implementations, which makes your code easier to maintain and extend.

<summary><b>4. What is Selenium 4?
</b></summary>

---

  <p>Selenium 4 is the latest version of Selenium WebDriver, which will be fully standardized with <a href='https://www.w3.org/'>W3C</a>. Since most browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge follow W3C standardization, browser drivers will interact with Selenium WebDriver in W3C standard protocol.</p>

<summary><b>5.What are the different waits in Selenium WebDriver?
</b></summary>

---

  <p>There are three types of waits in WebDriver:

**1. Implicit Waits:** This is a wait timeout that applies to an instance on a WebDriver. It implies that all actions of this instance are time-out only after waiting for a period of time.

**_Python Code_**
```Python

from selenium import webdriver

# Create a new instance of the Firefox driver
driver = webdriver.Firefox()

# Set implicit wait time to 10 seconds
driver.implicitly_wait(10)

# Navigate to a webpage
driver.get("http://www.example.com")

# Find an element
element = driver.find_element_by_id("some_id")

# Perform actions on the element
element.click()

# Close the browser
driver.quit()


```
**_Java Code_**
```Java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new instance of the Firefox driver
        WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();

        // Set implicit wait time to 10 seconds
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Navigate to a webpage
        driver.get("http://www.example.com");

        // Find an element
        WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("some_id"));

        // Perform actions on the element
        element.click();

        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
    }
}


```

**2. Explicit Waits:** This is an exclusive time-out method that works by adding code to delay the execution until a specific condition arises. It is more customizable in terms that we can set it up to wait for any suitable situation. Usually, we use a few of the pre-built expected conditions to wait for elements to become clickable, visible, invisible, etc.

**_Python Code_**
```Python

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Create a new instance of the Firefox driver
driver = webdriver.Firefox()

# Navigate to a webpage
driver.get("http://www.example.com")

# Wait for the element to be clickable
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "some_id")))

# Perform actions on the element
element.click()

# Close the browser
driver.quit()



```
**_Java Code_**
```Java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.WebDriverWait;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new instance of the Firefox driver
        WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();

        // Navigate to a webpage
        driver.get("http://www.example.com");

        // Set explicit wait time to 10 seconds
        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);

        // Wait for the element to be clickable
        WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("some_id")));

        // Perform actions on the element
        element.click();

        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
    }
}


```

**3. Fluent Waits:** This defines the maximum amount of time to wait for a particular condition and frequency to test the condition before throwing an exception to “ElementNotVisibleException.”</p>
